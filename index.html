         CarSpotter is a straightforward tracking application that allows users to store a list of spotted cars. To access your data across multiple devices, please create an account. Without an account, your data will be lost upon uninstalling the app or switching to a new device. The user's data is handled with the utmost security and privacy. As the developer, I do not have access to any images or stored locations within the CarSpotter app. All such data is stored directly on the user's device. CarSpotter does not endorse or support any illegal activities associated with the use of this application. Any information provided regarding the locations of exotic cars is solely based on user-generated content and word of mouth, not sourced or verified by CarSpotter. We do not store or possess any location data.
